    During my time at NIT Calicut I learnt most of my key skills that have I have taken through my career such as teamwork and working to tight deadlines. I thouroughly enjoyed my time at college and learnt a lot about a healthy work life balance.

    I spent a lot of my free time as a core committee member of the *NITC L&D club* taking on roles such as *president* *.
