    Lead2Sale is a Lead Management System which helps automate customer acquisition
    process.Customer Acquisition follows a sales pipeline which defines a typical step by
    step process that sales reps go through to convert a prospect into a paying customer.A
    sales stage is created for each step in the sales process.The sales rep is responsible
    for moving the stages as the prospect's interest level changes.The number of sales
    stages will vary based on the length of your sales cycle and the number of interactions
    needed to close a deal.
